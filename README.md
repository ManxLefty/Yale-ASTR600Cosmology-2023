# Astro/Physics 600 (Fall 2023)

This is the Github repository for the common parts of the Astro/Physics 600 
class for Fall 2023.

This is a work-in-progress. I am also going to err on the side of keeping outlines
current, even if incomplete.

Much of these notes are directly from/derived from many different sources. 
An incomplete bibliography/reference list is below, apologies for sources missed.
